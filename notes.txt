Parser Combinators Talk

1. Intro
    - so you need to write a parser?
    - primitive string operations
    - regexs
    - lex, yacc, JavaCC etc
    - simple idea from functional programming

2. What is the simplest parser we can think of?
    - dot
    - implement first with bool result
    - write test
    - discuss lack of information in bool result
    - discuss need for remaining string for combining parsers
    - refactor result type to including remaining input on Ok

3. More interesting parsers
    - string() amd integer()
    - quotedString()
    - test

4. Take stock
    - what have we so far?
    - lots of repetition in result types
    - add Parser<T> type aliases
    - refactor

5. Combining Parsers
    - what does it mean to combine parsers?
    - discuss semantics of sequence
    - what would a function that combines two parsers look like?
    - start with signature
    - note that params and return are all functions
    - implement unrolled version
    - add tests
    - discuss patterns in unrolled code
    - factor out inner `when` to ParseResult.map()
    - note that Result is acting as a Functor
    - factor out outer `when` to Result.flatMap()
    - note that ParseResult is acting as a Monad
    - discuss naming of flatMap()
    - rerun tests

6. Choice
    - the other main combinator is choice
    - both branches must yield the same type
    - implement and add positive tests
    - note that return values are the same for both branches
    - discuss adding result data to `string()`
    - add `Parser.means()`
    - discuss extension on function type
    - modify test to use `means()`
    - add a failing test case with 'a or b' expect message
    - implement and use `mapExpected`

7. Take advantage of Kotlin
    - `seq` can become infix `then`
    - `choice` can be come infix `or`

8. Other combinators
    - before    
    - then
    - between
    - many
    - sepBy
    - whitespace

9. Parsing JSON
    - add JSON model
    - add test case
    - trivial cases: null, true, false, int, string
    - start on array
    - stub array item to start with; focus on sepBy, between
    - we need the "full" json parser for items
    - seems like a disaster but there's a simple fix in `LazyParser<T>`
    - object parser is similar
    - finally add the full JSON parser
    - remember to set ref

10. Conclusion
    - parsers are just functions
    - with a few rules they are easy to combine
    - separating lex and grammar stages
    - error messages and source positions
    - you can't debug this by stepping through
    - debug by breaking down problems
